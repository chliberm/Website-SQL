            <h3>The process of recycling</h3>
            <p> After the collection of the recyclables, which can be done at different drop off centers, they are sent to a recovery center. There, they are first cleaned so that
            they can be then processed into usable materials that can be used to produce new products. These materials, just like raw materials, are sold to different companies 
            who use the processed recyclables to create their new products. The recycled material have a ever-changing market based on demand and availability. Many items, which 
            you might not be aware of, are made from such recycled content. A few examples of such items include paper towels, different drink containers, news paper, and many more.
            The recycling repeating cycle is not maintained unless consumers buy products the products made from the recycled materials and eventually recycle them as well (if possible.)

            <h3>Why recycle?</h3>
            <p> Among the many benifits of processing certain items and turning them into materials for new ones rather than trash, there are a few key positive outcomes to recycling.
                First and foremost, the regeneration of products from old ones reduces significantly the amount of trash in the landfill, an extremely harmful human ecological footprint.
                In addition to not adding as much waste, recycling also wastes less. Using the raw materials that have already been "harvested" reduces the amount of consumption of natural 
                resources such as timber, water, and minerals. The collection of raw material also results in pollution and significant usage of energy. Therefore, recycling, which reduce 
                the collection of raw materials, reduces also the pollution and energy spent on the collection process. Since a lot goes into the process of recycling, the industry creates 
                many jobs and therefore benefits the economy.
